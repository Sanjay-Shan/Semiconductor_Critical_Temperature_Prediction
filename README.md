# Superconductor Critical Temperature Prediction

This project was done as a part of the Curriculum and involved writing a IEEE format along side training a machine learning model for predicting thecritical temperature of the given superconductor.
 
The following was achieved and visualized in the coarse of the project
1. Dataset and descriptive analysis
   This involved the description of the datasets provided such as the data contained in the dataset. In simple words the first dataset included the physical and chemical    properties of the superconductors whereas the second dataset included the chemical elements in the superconductor material. 
2. Data Visualization
   Variance in the dataset
   Correlation of the data with the response variable
   Distribution of the Critical temperature
3. Data modelling methodologies
   Linear Regression -  This was used as the baseline model to understand the prediction capability of the linear model
   Random Forest - This was used to visualize the performance of the bagged model as well as the importance of the features in the dataset
   
# Results
1. Random Forest achieved the overall lowest MSE=179.35 as compared to Linear regression with MSE=361.12
2. Equally the R2 Statistic also shows the improvement in the prediction from Linear model to random forest model i.e.,0.622 - 0.8471
